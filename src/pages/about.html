        Totally tl;dr version 🥱
      </h3>

      <h1>Ever since I picked up my first piece of Lego I've been addicted to building things</h1>

      <p>
        I was 11 years old when my family got our first PC. I was obsessed. I used to love just clicking on things, digging around the Windows 95 OS like a crazed conquistador searching for gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Except in my case, my El Dorado turned out to be something called the World Wide Web. The moment that first webpage very slowly loaded on the 56k modem, I was hooked.

        <h3>
        I remember building my first website
      </h3>

      <p>
        We didn’t even have the internet at home, but I’d cycle to the central library every day after school to use the internet. I created my first website: a few pages about hints and tips for an old N64 wrestling game 😳.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was obviously terrible, but I didn't care. It was just thrilling to build something that<i class="dg-aside" title="Recently I found out, to my horror, it is still online 😱">&mdash;in theory at least&mdash;</i>anyone in the world could see. To my 13 year old self, it was as good as being on TV.
      </p>

      <p>
        I continued to build websites for any teenage interest I had at the time. I made websites for <i class="dg-aside" title="More accurately, leet Counter-Strike clans 😎">esports teams</i>. I posted a guitar tab for a Nirvana song. I published a hilariously short-lived School magazine. I created the UK’s most popular Evanescence fansite 🙈 (no, it is thankfully no longer online). It didn’t matter what it was, I loved building things.

      <h3>
        Design is for all of us
      </h3>

      <p class="lead">
        Many years later, I'm very much aware of the responsibility we have as designers. We are the interface between a human being and the systems on which they depend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Design should be inclusive. Now, more than ever, it is not acceptable to design systems that exclude users, whether it is favouring aesthetics over accessibility or sacrificing usability for features. We are not all blessed with perfect vision, years of niche experience, and expensive Apple displays.
      </p>

      <p>
        Designing for accessibility just makes sense, whether it is to support users with disabilities both permanent or temporary, or ensuring your product is usable in all manner of scenarios, either as a 10ft UI on a poorly calibrated board room TV or on a dim phone screen in full sunlight.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Inclusivity in design, however, doesn't stop at accessibility or usability. It's also critical to the design process.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I make design collaborative, regularly involving product managers, engineers, and any other subject matter expert. Everyone has ideas. A true designer is someone who can extract ideas from the chaos, no matter where they come from, and give them form.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          I think being a designer is one of the most fortunate professions there is, and it's a privelege for which I am forever grateful.

        Other Passions
      </h3>

      <h2>I love geeking out about things</h2>

      <p>
        Outside of design, my main interests revolve around eating and drinking. I’m a total coffee snob, and will spend my entire life chasing the perfect shot of espresso and tweaking variables for making the best flat white. I’m a few thousand attempts in and I feel like I’m barely scratching the surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        My main obsession, however, is and has always been food. <i class="dg-aside" title="Neapolitan pizzas and Californian burgers especially 😍">I love eating it, of course</i>. But even more than eating it, I love cooking it. The short feedback loop of adding something to the pot, observing the effect, reacting to it and learning from it is thrillingly addictive.

      <h3>
        Food is how we understand each other
      </h3>

      <p>
        Above all else, my interest in food feeds my hunger for understanding. In learning how a culture eats, you understand a bit about them: their shared history, their differences, the abundances and what they may take for granted, as well as the difficulties they face and the ingenuity it takes to overcome them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not designing, or making a mess in the kitchen, I love cycling, photography, and settling in for a good film with my wonderful wife and our two unruly cats.
