          Comprehensive design system with accessibility at the forefront

          The Chroma Design System was built to support a total rebrand GlobalWebIndex undertook for all of their multi-channel outputs
        </p>

        <p>
          The older style was showing its age, and was riddled with inconsistencies from years of updates by various designers and developers.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Seemingly no attention was paid to accessibility. In an age of inclusivity, this stuck out like an embarrassing anachronism.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Of course, creating a new design language is just one part of the equation. It must be supported and enforced throughout the product development lifecycle.

              From the outset, the design language treated accessibility as a first-class citizen. We committed to full adherence to the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1">WCAG 2.1</abbr> standard.
            </p>

            <p>
              Careful consideration was given to colours. The GWI platform makes heavy use of complex data visualisations. Every colour combination was carefully chosen and tested against various forms of colour deficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
              Many styles were tested to maximise legibility of large data sets that research professionals tend to work within. Contrast ratios and visual hierarchies were carefully considered to maximise usability and clarity.

        </h3>

        <h2>
          A multi-faceted design system for everyone
        </h2>

        <p class="lead">
          Chroma had a number of different users, each with different requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          A shared Sketch library utilising best-practice symbols and shared styles allowed the Product Designers in the team to work efficiently and consistently, while providing a solid foundation to be creative.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          A web portal served everyone else. The engineers now had a single source of truth for the core styles and components. Every colour variable in one place, with no button state left to chance.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the wider business, there was now a single place where everyone could go to find brand guidelines, typefaces, on-brand presentation templates, not to mention the <i class="dg-aside" title="I was gobsmacked by the several dozen incorrect versions of the company logo I found knocking about ðŸ™ˆ">proper company logo</i>!
