    <h1>
      Chroma Design System
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Comprehensive web and Sketch based design system that puts accessibility at the forefront
    </p>

    <p>
      GlobalWebIndex undertook a total rebranding exercise in 2018 that affected all of their multi-channel outputs. The older style was beginning to show its age, and over time it became riddled with inconsistencies from years of updates by various designers and developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the problems with the legacy design language was how little attention was paid to web accessibility. In an age of increasing inclusivity in all walks of life, this stuck out like an embarrassing anachronism.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Accessibility as a fundamental user right, not an afterthought
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Of course, designing to meet accessibility standards is just one part of the equation. Those standards have to be enforced throughout the product development lifecycle. The design, marketing, engineering and product teams all need a single source of truth.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chroma was built to solve those needs, being a one stop place for all resources relating to the design language that anyone can use as a starting point to get them what they need.

          Key Challenge
        </h3>

        <h2>
          Driven by three design principles
        </h2>

        <p>
          It started with three core design principles that I believe to be universally vital: Inclusivity, Clarity, and Empowerment.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the outset, this redesign was focused on delivering full adherence to <abbr>WCAG 2.1</abbr>. I believe that every UI should be made as inclusive as it can possibly be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Careful consideration was given to colours. The GWI platform makes heavy use of complex data visualisations. Every colour combination was carefully chosen and tested against various forms of colour deficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of the outputs of GWI data are dense and need to be as readable as possible. Many styles were tested to maximise legibility of these large data sets. Contrast ratios and visual hierarchies were carefully considered to ensure the most clarity.

      Outcomes
    </h3>

    <h2>
      Delivering a multi-faceted design system
    </h2>

    <p>
      As a design system, Chroma had a number of different users, each with different requirements. The solution was multi-faceted, comprising of a web portal and a shared Sketch library.
    </p>

    <p>
      For product designers in the team, Chroma is comprised of a comprehensive UI kit built in Sketch, utilising the latest best-practices for how symbols and shared styles are set up allowing designers to focus on the design.
    </p>

    <p>
      The engineers&mdash;all of whom work remotely&mdash;need definitive documentation of the core components that they frequently use. Every colour variable in one place, with no button state was left chance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The marketing and information design teams needed a single source of truth for the latest complete branding guidelines. Everyone in the company would know where to go to download the corporate typeface or find various templates.
