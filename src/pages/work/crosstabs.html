      Crosstabs GlobalWebIndex
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Backed by popular client demand, GlobalWebIndex undertook a project that would redefine how users were able to discover insights exponentially faster than they could before.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nature of the GlobalWebIndex's legacy platform design meant that it was extremely time-consuming for certain operations that research professionals needed to perform. Audience profiles could only be checked one question at a time, with a limited number of available segmentation options.
    </p>

    <p>
      This meant that it was extremely difficult for GWI to appeal to hardcore researchers who had been accustomed to relying on long-established cross-tabbing tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Crosstabs was designed to fulfil this requirement. It would also redefine how analysis is done throughout the rest of the platform.

    <h2>
      The chat had to feel engaging for any duration
    </h2>

    <p>
      I designed the chat experience. Starting with Sketch, my thinking behind the design was to keep the UI elements to an absolute minimum. Users would be answering in lengthy surveys with numerous questions, some of which can be wordy.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to make the chat feel like a real chat, I created a finely-tuned prototype built in HTML, CSS & Javascript.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Getting the interaction design to feel “just right” was critical to keeping the chat feeling delightful and fresh.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Building the prototype in the same language of the developed app meant that there was no approximation of what it would feel like; I could find out exactly how it would behave, warts and all, on all the numerous browsers and devices we would support.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, it also made handover to the engineers as simple as copy and paste. I’ve found it helps when, as a designer, I can speak the same language as the engineers.

          I was able to test multiple types of questions that would represent the real survey, where some questions are short and snappy, some wordy, and some with lots of options to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also allowed me to see how it felt to spend an extended amount of time answering questions; to see how fatigue might set in, and where to inject some variety as required. The UI was stripped of all superflous elements to minimise cognitive load.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Ideas that looked right in a static Sketch file were discovered to be suboptimal when put to the paces in someone’s hands.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I tweaked the transitions and animations of every UI element until everything felt right. Timings became super important. If something felt too slow it would feel like a chore. Too fast and it caused fatigue. Everything had to feel right, or the spell would be broken.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through rounds of guerilla testing with users, I was able to rapidly iterate on ideas. New and unexpected solutions uncovered themselves in a way they wouldn’t have if I had stuck to using static mockups.
