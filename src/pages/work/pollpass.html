    <h1>
      Pollpass Chat Bot
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Disrupting the well-established market research industry with an innovative and exciting new way to get peoples’ opinions en-masse.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pollpass was built from the ground up to be a transparent, GDPR-compliant way of collecting research data directly from a broad variety of digital consumers. With the increasing difficulty in passive data collection such as cookie-tracking, active data methods such as surveys have become vitally important. However, traditional surveys have their own issues.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It has historically been difficult to attract a statistically representative set of users to spend, say, 30 minutes to complete a market research survey.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Traditional users of market research surveys skew heavily toward full-time parents and students. With Pollpass, we wanted to get a more representative set of users by appealing with best-in-class ease of use and delight.

      Key Challenge
    </h3>

    <h2>
      The chat had to feel engaging for any duration
    </h2>

    <p>
      From the outset my intent was to keep the UI elements to an absolute minimum. Users would be completing lengthy surveys with numerous questions, some of which can be wordy and repetitive. Any superflous UI elements would add to the cognitive load and could lead to fatigue.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order to make the experience feel like a real chat, I created a finely-tuned prototype built in HTML, CSS & Javascript. As mobile was the primary target, everything had to feel right from touch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building the prototype in the same language of the developed app eliminated guesswork. I could find out exactly how it would behave, warts and all, on all the numerous browsers and devices we would support. Of course, it also made handover to the engineers as simple as copy and paste.

          I was able to test all of the various types of questions that would represent a real market research survey, from short snappy questions with just a few choices to longer questions with a long list of items to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also allowed me to see how it felt to spend an extended amount of time answering questions: to see how fatigue might set in, and where to inject some variety as required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Timings became super important. Transitions and animations were carefully tweaked until everything felt right. If something felt too slow it would feel like a chore. Too fast and it caused fatigue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through rounds of guerilla testing with users, I was able to rapidly iterate on ideas. New and unexpected solutions uncovered themselves in a way they wouldn’t have if I had stuck to using static mockups.
