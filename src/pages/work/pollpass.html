          Pollpass Chat Bot

          Built from the ground up to be a transparent and GDPR-compliant way of collecting research data directly from a variety of digital consumers.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the increasing difficulty in passive tracking-based data collection, active collection methods such as surveys have become vitally important.

            It has historically been difficult to attract a representative set of users to spend 30 minutes completing a market research survey.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Traditional users of market research surveys skew heavily toward students and full-time parents. With Pollpass, we targeted a wider demographic by appealing with personality and delight.

          Minimising cognitive load was a key objective in order to keep things interesting and reduce fatigue.

          As users would be completing lengthy surveys with numerous questions&mdash;some of which can be wordy and repetitive&mdash;UI elements were kept to an absolute minimum.

        <p>
          A design mockup doesn't tell you anything about how an app would feel after using it for an extended period of time, so I built a prototype that could.

    <h2>
      A prototype allowed me to simulate a real chat
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">
      With a data-driven HTML/CSS/JS prototype I was able to test all manner of survey questions, from the short and snappy to the wordy and repetitive.
    </p>

        <p>
          I could see how it felt to spend an extended amount of time answering questions: to see where fatigue might set in, and where to inject some variety as required.

            Ideas that looked fine in a mockup were found out when put to the paces in someoneâ€™s hands.

        <p>
          Timings became super important. Transitions and animations were carefully tweaked until everything felt right.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was able to rapidly iterate on ideas with quick and dirty guerilla testing. Unexpected solutions uncovered themselves in ways they mightn't have from static mockups.
