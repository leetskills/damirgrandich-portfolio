          Boosting store footfall with DOOH
        </h1>

        <p class="lead">
          Store Boost connects live footfall data with Programmatic Digital Out of Home to deliver targeted messaging to potential customers nearby.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Cloud + Compass' proprietary footfall tracking technology enables stores and restaurants to analyse their store's current footfall and trends over time and compare these with the local area.

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Using a Programmatic DOOH bidder, stores can run advertising on the digital panels around them and measure the impact it has on their footfall in-store.

          Keep It Simple, Stupid ðŸ’‹
        </h2>

        <p class="lead">
          The design process I used reflected the simplicity of the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kicking off the design sprint with super lo-fi collaborative sketching allowed a rapid development of ideas before going into the high-fidelity visual design stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made sure that the handover to the engineers was as easy as possible by building part of the front-end for them, freeing them of the pain of getting the UI layout to spec.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I made sure everything in the design could be built, because, well, I'd actually built it.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The fully responsive prototype's HTML &amp; SASS code was of a high enough standard that the engineers could literally copy and paste. The charting library was fully implemented.
        </p>

        <p>
          Everything was in place so that the engineers could focus on the important things: building the functionality.
