      Vow Made
    </h1>

    <p class="lead">
      Ahead of the curve with in-housing the digital advertising workflow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vow is a startup with one main focus - to allow brands to take back control of their digital advertising.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        No one knows their brand better than the brand managers.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Media agencies have proven themselves to be unreliable or even untrustworthy with how they handle a brand.
    </p>

    <p>
      Vow was designed from the outset to be easy to use and to just work with whatever your ad tech stack is.

          I was able to test all of the various types of questions that would represent a real market research survey, from short snappy questions with just a few choices to longer questions with a long list of items to choose from.
        </p>

        <p>
          It also allowed me to see how it felt to spend an extended amount of time answering questions: to see how fatigue might set in, and where to inject some variety as required.
        </p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Timings became super important. Transitions and animations were carefully tweaked until everything felt right. If something felt too slow it would feel like a chore. Too fast and it caused fatigue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through rounds of guerilla testing with users, I was able to rapidly iterate on ideas. New and unexpected solutions uncovered themselves in a way they wouldn’t have if I had stuck to using static mockups.
