          Vow enables brands to take back control of their marketing supply chain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Increasingly brands are bringing marketing in-house, and they need new solutions to effectively replace what they have relied upon external agencies to provide for them.

        <p>
          Vow was designed to be an easy to use solution that connects all of a customer's ad-tech stack and enables true omni-channel marketing.

          Media industries have evolved over time to do things in their own peculiar ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is no mean feat to crack open the secretive world of the agencies, and democratise creative and media so that brands can learn to take things into their own hands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vow takes a streamlined, unified approach that takes the best of each and ditches the inefficient, the fraudulent, and the just plain ugly.
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach poses a number of challenges: to retain learned behaviours while making precision improvements, all while making it as easy to use as possible.

        <p>
          For such a massive application in constant flux at the early startup stage, I had to be quite strategic in my approach to the design and prototype build.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            For efficiency, not to mention my own sanity, I stuck to the <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> principle.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          I used a heavily component-led design incorporating reusable Sketch symbols. This allowed rapid design updates whenever the need arose.
        </p>

            srcset="/assets/images/work/vow/vow-code.png 1x,

            alt="Screenshot of the prototype code for Vow"
            class="img-fluid rounded w-100">
        </p>

        <p>
          This approach was even more critical in the prototype, where a considerable data structure and reusable code components acted as the foundation behind the huge number of pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          The outcome was a beautiful high-fidelity fully clickable prototype that the customer could present to potential partners and investors.
